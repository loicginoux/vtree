this is used internally to attach all plugins to the object 'this'. Every core object have in their constructor something like:
{% highlight js%}
Vtree.init.apply(this, [settings, "<classname>"])
{% endhighlight %}
where classname is node, tree or nodeStore.
what it actually does is attaching all core functions/variables and all plugin functions/variable to the className object.
