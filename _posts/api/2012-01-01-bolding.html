<p>This plugin allow to bold a node when clicking it (can be used for selection on a tree). You can parameter the initial state of a node and make that bolding a node affect his parents/children the same way the checkbox plugin does (see <a href="Vtree/api/plugins/checkbox">checkbox API</a>)</p>
<p>Note that this plugin basically add a class "bold" to a node html element. You can overwrite the css rule to make the node the way you want it when clicking the node.</p>
