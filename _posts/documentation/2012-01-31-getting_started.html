<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>This is what you need to do to get started:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Download and uncompress the archive.</li>
	<li>install the files under the dist directory into your own application. The minimum file you need are vtree.js and vtree.css. Then If you need some icons, install the images too.</li>
	<li>This project is based on jQuery and json2. If you haven't installed this files yet in your application, you can find them under the lib directory.</li>
	<li>Follow this <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/examples/basic/">basic example</a> to get your first tree.</li>
	<li>You will find different examples in the archive as well if you need more help.</li>
	<li>If there is anything wrong, just open an issue <a href="https://github.com/vtree/vtree/issues">on github</a></li>
</ul>
